(a) SOURCE:
- https://www.kaggle.com/pranavkrishna/vgsales?select=vgsales.csv
- note: I shortened the data to only 25 columns since took too long for SQL browser to process.

(b) BRIEF DESC:
-TABLE games
	-contains information about the games consisting of
	name, year, and ranking.
	-ranking is used as primary key since no duplicate in existing data
	therefore a unique identifier.
-TABLE publishers
	-contains information about the publishers consisting of
	name and highest ranking.
	-ranking becomes a foreign key that references to games ranking.
-TABLE sales
	-contains information about the sales of each game
	data consisting of ranking, name, publisher name,
	and various sales data (USA, Europe, Japan, Global).
	-ranking becomes a foreign key that references to games ranking.

(c) CHALLENGES:
-I am still barely understanding the concept of foreign keys and found it really
hard to think in an ordered-style since foreign key can only occur from a primary key
in a pre-existing table.

(d) THREE NON-TRIVIAL INFO REQUEST
-requesting to view list of games.
	-select * games;
-requesting to view list of publishers.
	-select * publishers;
-requesting to view sales based off ranking.
	-select 1 from sales;
